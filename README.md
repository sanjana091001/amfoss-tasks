A little bit about myself:

I am Sanjana and I come from Ernakulam, Kerala. I joined Amrita because I've heard very positive responses from seniors and other alumni members. Also, I've heard that the mentorship and guidance offered by FOSS@amrita is one of a kind and I really wish to be a part of it.
