## Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a>
This README file gives a description about the tasks I have done and a little about how I did them.

## Task-0 <a name="Task-0"></a>
Task-0 was to install Ubuntu.
The Zeroth Task was to install Ubuntu which I have done by installing the OS file to a live USB and booting my computer from that. 
Utility I used to burn my file to my live pendrive: https://www.balena.io/etcher/

## Task-1 <a name="Task-1"></a>
Task-1 was to star all the amFOSS repositories in GitHub. 
I copied the script from star.user.js and pasted it on my Console(Developer Tools). Once I was finished,it showed an "It's Done" message. I have attached the screenshot of the Starred Repositories column of my GitHub page.
